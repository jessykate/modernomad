# Modernomad

Modernomad is an operating platform for collaborative spaces. It aims to
facilitate democratic management, empower people with information, and enable
meaningful connections for groups that value openness, collaboration and
participation.

Main features include profiles, mailing lists, guest and booking
management, events, static content, and community management. A [detailed
feature list](docs/features.md) is also available.
